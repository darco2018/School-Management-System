The sql database is set up automatically be loading data from schema.sql in resources.

It is good security practice that after your database is in production state, you make spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none 
 and revoke all privileges from the MySQL user connected to the Spring application, then give him 
 only SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE.
